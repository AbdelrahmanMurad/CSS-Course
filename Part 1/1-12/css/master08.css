/*
 Explanation of the different parts:

Content - The content of the box, where text and images appear
Padding - Clears an area around the content. The padding is transparent
Border - A border that goes around the padding and content
Margin - Clears an area outside the border. The margin is transparent
The box model allows us to add a border around elements, and to define space between elements. 
 The outline between border and margin.

!Padding only takes positive values.
!Negatives are ignored or treated as 0, which would have the same effect: none.
*Margins can have negative values, as can other position related properties, but not padding.
